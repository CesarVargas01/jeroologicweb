feat: Configure Astro for Vercel deployment and server-side rendering

This commit configures the Astro project for deployment to Vercel and enables server-side rendering for API routes.

- Installs and integrates the `@astrojs/vercel` adapter.
- Sets the `output` mode to `server` in `astro.config.mjs`.
- Updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to reflect new dependency.
