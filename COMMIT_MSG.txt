fix: Explicitly set Vercel adapter in Astro config

Explicitly sets the Vercel adapter in `astro.config.mjs` using `adapter: vercel()` to ensure it's correctly recognized during the build process. This addresses the `NoAdapterInstalled` error encountered during local builds.

Updates `package-lock.json` due to dependency changes.
